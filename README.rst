happylogging
============================

Utility functions to help using standard logging module.


Requirements
============

* Python 3.4 or later


Configure logging
=========================


initlog()
----------------

``initlog(logger=None, overwrite=True, level=None, format=DEFAULT_FORMAT, propagate=False, filename=None, rotate=None, backups=0, encoding=None, syslog=None, facility=None)``


``initlogin()`` configures various logging in a function.

``logger`` is a name of logger or logger instance to configure. If ``logger`` is None or empty string, Root logger is configured. 

Logging configuration is overwritten if ``overwrite`` is ``True``. To add handler to the logger instead of replace, ``overwrite`` should be ``False``. 

``level`` should be an one of ``'CRITICAL'``, ``'WARNING'``, ``'INFO'``, ``'DEBUG'``.


Configure to logging to files
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

``filename`` is a comma separated list of file names to emit logs. To print to a stdout, specify ``-`` as filename.

::

   import happylogging
   initlog(filename='log.log, -', level='DEBUG')   # Logging to log.log and stdout


``rotate`` specifies how to log files rotated. 

- rotate by size

  You can specify size to rotates file such as ``100mb`` or ``2gb``.

::

    initlog(filename='log.log', rotate='10mb')   # Rotate files every 10 MB.

- rotate by time.

  You can specify when to rotate files. Valid values are conbination of interval value and type.

  - Digits followed by ``'S'`` specify to rotate every n seconds. e.g. ``100S`` rotates in every 100 seconds. Similary, ``'M'``, ``"H"`` and ``"D"`` specify Minutes, Hours and Days respecivly.

  - To rotate every day, you can specify time to rotate such as ``02:00``.

::

    initlog(filename='log.log', rotate='10D')   # Rotate files in every 10 Days
    initlog(filename='log.log', rotate='04:30')   # Rotate files at 04:30 every day

- If rotate specified, you can also specify number of backups of log file to ``backups`` arg.

::

    initlog(filename='log.log', rotate='10D', backups=10)   # Retain 10 back ups

- ``encoding`` specifies encoding of log file.


Configure to logging to syslog
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


To logging to syslog server, you can use ``syslog`` to specify syslog servers as commna separated list of servers. Each servers are apecified as ``HOST:PORT`` form or ``/path/to/udp/port`` form. If ``syslog`` is omitted, ``localhost:514`` is assumed. To logging to syslog, ``facility`` must not be omitted.


::

    initlog(syslog='/dev/log, example:514', facility='syslog')   # Send to local port and host 'example'

::

    initlog(filename='-', facility='syslog')  # Send to stdout and local syslog server.



Utility functions
========================

After ``happylogging`` was imported, logging methods such as ``logging.info()`` gains some addtional methods.

block()/encblock()
--------------------

Define indented block of logs.

::

   >>> import logging, happylogging
   >>> happylogging.initlog(filename='log.log', level='DEBUG')
   >>> logging.debug('first line')
   >>> logging.debug.block()
   >>> logging.debug('indented!')
   >>> logging.debug.block()
   >>> logging.debug('more indented!')
   >>> logging.debug.endblock()
   >>> logging.debug.endblock()
   >>> logging.debug('no more!')
   >>> print(open('log.log').read())
   2016-06-19 14:50:01,121 DEBUG first line
   2016-06-19 14:50:24,225 DEBUG   indented!
   2016-06-19 14:50:35,806 DEBUG     more indented!
   2016-06-19 14:50:56,835 DEBUG no more!

Indent is defined per thread and logging level (CRITICAL, WARNING, ...).

setcolor(color=None)
----------------------

Change color of log if log is directed to the tty. ``color`` should be one of string 
``"RED"``, ``"GREEN"``, ``"YELLOW"``, ``"BLUE"``, ``"MAGENTA"``,``"CYAN"``.

To reset color, specify ``None`` as color.

``setcolor()`` doesn't work if output device is file or syslogs.

::

   >>> happylogging.initlog(filename='-', level='DEBUG')  # log to console
   >>> logging.debug.setcolor("RED")   # Change text color of debug to red.
   >>> logging.debug.setcolor(None)    # Restore color
